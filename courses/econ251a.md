title: "ECON 251A: Labor Economics I (Economics of Human Capital)"
---

#### Course Information
This course is intended to provide a solid understanding of the main ideas in the â€œEconomics of Human Capital". This covers much of the first part of a traditional graduate Labor Economics sequence. The course will involve two main components:
- A chalk-and-talk component in which I will discuss the material we are studying.
- A discussion component in which you are given a key paper in this field and asked to discuss it. See the course website for details of the papers to be discussed.
- Homework assignments that explore both the theory that we discuss in class and include a data component that require you to apply some of the concepts discussed in class.
